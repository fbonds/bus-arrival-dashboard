# Bus Arrival Dashboard

Google, OneBusAway, and other apps offer real-time bus arrival information. The OneBusAway app even displays animation with bus locations.

Sometimes you need something much simpler. I live close to two bus stops and different buses that can get me to my destination (work) stop at each of them. A dashboard listing only the buses I am interested in at only the stops I am interested in would be great in the morning. It should group the buses by stop and sort them by arrival time. Color coding would help me decide which stop to head to once I walk out the door.
